Each entry in the airline delay database represents the aggregate
monthly data for a particular airline at a particular airport. For
example, one entry might be the delay information for Southwest
Airlines at St Louis Airport during December 2003.

Each entry lists the number of flights, the number of flights delayed
(15 minutes beyond the scheduled arrival time), the number of flights
canceled and diverted, the minutes of delay due to carrier delay -
weather delay - national air system delays - security delay. The _ct
fields list the count of flights experiencing each delay (they add up
the arr_del15 column). Because a flight can have multiple delay types,
these numbers are real numbers. For example, if a flight was 30
minutes late, 15 minutes due to weather and 15 minutes due to security
it will contribute .5 to weather_ct and .5 to security_ct. It will
also contribute 15 to the weather_delay field and 15 to the
security_delay field.

Finally, the arr_delay column is the sum of total delay minutes for
the document (that is â€¦ arr_delay = carrier_delay+ weather_delay +
nas_delay + security_delay + late_aircraft_delay)

arr_flights Count of flights
arr_del15 Count of flights delayed (>15minutes)
carrier_ct Late due to carrier (maintenance or crew problems, aircraft
cleaning, baggage loading, fueling, etc)
weather_ct Late due to weather (Significant meteorological conditions )
nas_ct Late due to National Aviation Delay System (non-extreme weather
conditions, airport operations, heavy traffic volume, and air traffic
control)
security_ct Late due to evacuation of a terminal or concourse,
re-boarding of aircraft because of security breach, inoperative
screening equipment and/or long lines in excess of 29 minutes at
screening areas
late_aircraft_ct A previous flight with same aircraft arrived late,
causing the present flight to depart late.
arr_cancelled Count of aircraft cancelled
arr_diverted Count of aircrafts diverted
